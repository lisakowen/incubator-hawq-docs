HAWQ is pre-installed with a number of client utility applications. You can also run client applications in your HAWQ deployment created using standard ODBC/JDBC Application Interfaces.

Alternatively, you may want to provide access to your HAWQ master node from a Linux client outside of your HAWQ cluster. One option to enable this access is to install the full HAWQ binary on the client node. A second option is to create a minimal `psql` client package from an existing HAWQ installation which you could then install on a non-HAWQ client. Refer to [User-Created HAWQ psql Client](hawq-client-pkg.html) for instructions on creating, installing, and running such a package.

## <a id="hawqclient_pkg_run"></a>HAWQ-Installed Client Applications

HAWQ is installed with a number of client utility applications. These applications are located in the `$GPHOME/bin` directory of your HAWQ master host installation. The following client utility applications are the most commonly used:

|Name|Usage|
|----|-----|
|`createdb`|create a new database|
|`createlang`|define a new procedural language|
|`createuser`|define a new database role|
|`dropdb`|remove a database|
|`droplang`|remove a procedural language|
|`dropuser`|remove a role|
|`psql`|PostgreSQL interactive terminal|
|`reindexdb`|reindex a database|
|`vacuumdb`|garbage-collect and analyze a database|

When using these client applications, you must connect to a database through the HAWQ master instance. You will need to know the name of your target database, the host name and port number of the master, and what database user name to connect as. This information can be provided on the command-line using the options `-d`, `-h`, `-p`, and `-U` respectively. If an argument is found that does not belong to any option, it will be interpreted as the database name first.

All of these options have default values which will be used if the option is not specified. The default host is the local host. The default port number is 5432. The default user name is your OS system user name, as is the default database name. Note that OS user names and HAWQ user names are not necessarily the same.

If the default values are not correct, you can set the environment variables `PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, and `PGUSER` to the appropriate values, or use a `psql``~/.pgpass` file to contain frequently-used passwords.
