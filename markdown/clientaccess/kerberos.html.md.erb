Kerberos is an encrpyted network authentication protocol for client/server applications. You should familiarize yourself with Kerberos concepts before configuring Kerberos for your HAWQ cluster. For more information about Kerberos, see [http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/).

HAWQ supports Kerberos at both the HDFS and/or user authentication levels. You will perform distinct configuration procedures for each.

When Kerberos is enabled for your HDFS filesystem, HAWQ, as an HDFS client, requires a principal and keytab file to authenticate access to HDFS (filesystem) and YARN (resource management).

When Kerberos authentication is enabled at the user level, HAWQ uses the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface \(GSSAPI\) to provide automatic authentication \(single sign-on\). When HAWQ uses Kerberos user authentication, HAWQ itself and the HAWQ users \(roles\) that require Kerberos authentication require a principal and keytab. When a user attempts to log in to HAWQ, HAWQ uses its Kerberos principal to connect to the Kerberos server, and presents the user's principal for Kerberos validation. If the user principal is valid, login succeeds and the user can access HAWQ. Conversely, the login fails and HAWQ denies access to the user if the principal is not valid.

Kerberos provides a secure, encrypted authentication service. It does not encrypt data exchanged between the client and database and provides no authorization services. To encrypt data exchanged over the network, you must use an SSL connection. To manage authorization for access to HAWQ databases and objects such as schemas and tables, you assign privileges to HAWQ users and roles. For information about managing authorization privileges, see [Overview of HAWQ Authorization](hawq-access-checks.html).

## <a id="kerberos_prereq"></a>Prerequisites 

Before configuring Kerberos authentication for HAWQ, ensure that:

-   System time on the Kerberos server and HAWQ hosts is synchronized. \(For example, install the `ntp` package on both servers.\)
-   Network connectivity exists between the Kerberos server and all nodes in the HAWQ cluster.
-   Java 1.7.0\_17 or later is installed on all nodes in your cluster. Java 1.7.0_17 is required to use Kerberos-authenticated JDBC on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x or 7.x.
-   You can identify the Key Distribution Center \(KDC\) server you use for Kerberos authentication. See [Appendix: Install and Configure a Kerberos KDC Server](#task_setup_kdc) if you have not yet set up your KDC.

## <a id="nr166539"></a>Enabling Kerberos Authentication for HAWQ 

You will perform the following tasks to set up Kerberos authentication with HAWQ:

1.  Identify your Kerberos Key Distribution Center \(KDC\) server.
2.  If you choose to enable Kerberos at the HDFS filesystem level, you will create and deploy principals for your HDFS cluster, and ensure that Kerberos authentication is enabled and functioning for all HDFS client services, including HAWQ and PXF. See [Configure HAWQ/PXF for Secure HDFS](#task_kerbhdfs).
3. If you choose to configure Kerberos user authentication for HAWQ, you will: 
    1. Create principals for the HAWQ master database process and `gpadmin` or other administrative user and configure HAWQ to use Kerberos authentication for user access. See [Configure HAWQ for Kerberos User Authentication](#hawq_kerb_cfg)
    2. Create and optionally distribute Kerberos principals and keytabs for HAWQ users. See [Configure Kerberos-Authenticated HAWQ Users](#hawq_kerb_user_cfg).
    3. Generate a ticket to authenticate access to a kerberized HAWQ. See [Authenticate User Access to HAWQ](#hawq_kerb_dbaccess).

    With Kerberos configured for your HAWQ cluster, you can use Kerberos authentication for PSQL, JDBC, and Ranger access to HAWQ.


### <a id="task_kerbhdfs"></a>Configure HAWQ/PXF for Secure HDFS

Both Kerberos and Hadoop are complex subsystems. Detailing the Kerberos configuration for your Hadoop cluster is beyond the scope of this document. 

#### <a id="task_kerbhdfs_ambarimgd"></a>Procedure for Ambari-Managed Clusters

If you manage your cluster with Ambari, you will enable Kerberos authentication for your cluster as described in the [Enabling Kerberos Authentication Using Ambari](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.5.3/bk_security/content/configuring_amb_hdp_for_kerberos.html) Hortonworks documentation. The Ambari **Kerberos Security Wizard** guides you through the kerberization process, including installing Kerberos client packages on cluster nodes, syncing Kerberos configuration files, updating cluster configuration, and creating and distributing the Kerberos principals and keytab files for your Hadoop cluster services, including HAWQ and PXF. 


#### <a id="task_kerbhdfs_cmdlinemgd"></a>Procedure for Command-Line-Managed Clusters

##### <a id="task_kerbhdfs_cmdlinemgd_prereq"></a>Prerequisites

If you manage your cluster from the command line, before you configure HAWQ and PXF for access to a secure HDFS filesystem ensure that you have:

- Enabled Kerberos for your Hadoop cluster per the instructions for your specific distribution and verified the configuration.

- Verified that the HDFS configuration parameter `dfs.block.access.token.enable` is set to `true`. You can find this setting in the `hdfs-site.xml` configuration file.

- Noted the host name or IP address of your HAWQ master (\<master\>) and KDC (\<kdc-server\>) nodes.

- Noted the name of the Kerberos \<realm\> in which your cluster resides.

- Distributed the `/etc/krb5.conf` Kerberos configuration file on the KDC server node to **each** HAWQ and PXF cluster node if not already present. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh root@<hawq-node>
    root@hawq-node$ cp /etc/krb5.conf /save/krb5.conf.save
    root@hawq-node$ scp <kdc-server>:/etc/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf
    ```

- Verified that the Kerberos client packages are installed on **each** HAWQ and PXF node.

    ``` shell
    root@hawq-node$ rpm -qa | grep krb
    root@hawq-node$ yum install krb5-libs krb5-workstation
    ```

##### <a id="task_kerbhdfs_cmdlinemgd_steps"></a>Procedure

Perform the following steps to configure HAWQ and PXF for a secure HDFS. You will perform operations on both the HAWQ \<master\> and the \<kdc-server\> nodes.

1.  Log in to the KDC server as the `root` user.

    ``` shell
    $ ssh root@<kdc-server>
    root@kdc-server$ 
    ```

2.  Use the `kadmin.local` command to create a Kerberos principal for the `postgres` user. Substitute your \<realm\>. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “addprinc -randkey postgres@REALM.DOMAIN”
    ```

3.  Use `kadmin.local` to create a Kerberos service principal for **each** host on which a PXF agent is configured and running. The service principal should be of the form `pxf/<host>@<realm>` where \<host\> is the DNS resolvable, fully-qualified hostname of the PXF host system \(output of `hostname -f` command\).

    For example, these commands add service principals for three PXF nodes on the hosts host1.example.com, host2.example.com, and host3.example.com:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -randkey pxf/host1.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN"
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -randkey pxf/host2.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN"
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -randkey pxf/host3.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN"
    ```

    **Note:** As an alternative, if you have a hosts file that lists the fully-qualified domain name of each PXF host \(one host per line\), then you can generate principals using the command:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ for HOST in $\(cat hosts\) ; do sudo kadmin.local -q "addprinc -randkey pxf/$HOST@REALM.DOMAIN" ; done
    ```

4.  Generate a keytab file for each principal that you created in the previous steps \(i.e. `postgres` and each `pxf/<host>`\). Save the keytab files in any convenient location \(this example uses the directory `/etc/security/keytabs`\). You will deploy the service principal keytab files to their respective HAWQ and PXF host machines in a later step. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “xst -k /etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab postgres@REALM.DOMAIN”
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “xst -k /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host1.service.keytab pxf/host1.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN”
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “xst -k /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host2.service.keytab pxf/host2.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN”
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “xst -k /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host3.service.keytab pxf/host3.example.com@REALM.DOMAIN”
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “listprincs”
    ```

    Repeat the `xst` command as necessary to generate a keytab for each HAWQ and PXF service principal that you created in the previous steps.

5.  The HAWQ master server requires a `/etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab` keytab file for the HDFS principal. If this file does not already exist on the HAWQ master node, create the principal and generate the keytab. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “addprinc -randkey hdfs@REALM.DOMAIN”
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q “xst -k /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab hdfs@REALM.DOMAIN”
    ```

6.  Copy the HAWQ service keytab file \(and the HDFS headless keytab file if you created one) to the HAWQ master segment host. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ scp /etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab <master>:/etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ scp /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab <master>:/etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab
    ```

7.  Change the ownership and permissions on `hawq.service.keytab` (and `hdfs.headless.keytab`) as follows:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ ssh <master> chown gpadmin:gpadmin /etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh <master> chmod 400 /etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh <master> chown hdfs:hdfs /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh <master> chmod 400 /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab
    ```

8.  Copy the keytab file for each PXF service principal to its respective host. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ scp /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host1.service.keytab host1.example.com:/etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ scp /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host2.service.keytab host2.example.com:/etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ scp /etc/security/keytabs/pxf-host3.service.keytab host3.example.com:/etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    ```

    Note the keytab file location on each PXF host; you will need this  information for a later configuration step.

9. Change the ownership and permissions on the `pxf.service.keytab` files. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host1.example.com chown pxf:pxf /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host1.example.com chmod 400 /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host2.example.com chown pxf:pxf /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host2.example.com chmod 400 /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host3.example.com chown pxf:pxf /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    root@kdc-server$ ssh host3.example.com chmod 400 /etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab
    ```

10. On **each** PXF node, edit the `/etc/pxf/conf/pxf-site.xml` configuration file to identify the local keytab file and security principal name. Add or uncomment the properties, substituting your \<realm\>. For example:

    ``` xml
    <property>
        <name>pxf.service.kerberos.keytab</name>
        <value>/etc/security/keytabs/pxf.service.keytab</value>
        <description>path to keytab file owned by pxf service
        with permissions 0400</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>pxf.service.kerberos.principal</name>
        <value>pxf/_HOST@REALM.DOMAIN</value>
        <description>Kerberos principal pxf service should use.
        _HOST is replaced automatically with hostnames
        FQDN</description>
    </property>
    ```

    Also uncomment the KDC section in `yarn-client.xml` if you want to configure YARN for security.  ?? THERE IS NO KDC SECTION TO COMMENT OUT ??

11. Perform the remaining steps on the HAWQ master node as the `gpadmin` user:
    1.  Log in to the HAWQ master node and set up the HAWQ runtime environment:

        ``` shell
        $ ssh gpadmin@<master>
        gpadmin@master$ source /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
        ```

    2.  Run the following commands to configure Kerberos HDFS security for HAWQ and identify the keytab file:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@master$ hawq config -c enable_secure_filesystem -v ON
        gpadmin@master$ hawq config -c krb_server_keyfile -v /etc/security/keytabs/hawq.service.keytab
        ```

    3.  Start the HAWQ service:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@master$ hawq start cluster -a
        ```

    4.  Obtain a HDFS Kerberos ticket and change the ownership and permissions of the HAWQ HDFS data directory, substituting the HDFS data directory path for your HAWQ cluster. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@master$ sudo -u hdfs kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/hdfs.headless.keytab hdfs
        gpadmin@master$ sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown -R ??postgres??:gpadmin /<hawq_data_hdfs_path>
        ```

    5.  On the **HAWQ master node and each segment node**, edit the `/usr/local/hawq/etc/hdfs-client.xml` file to enable kerberos security and assign the HDFS NameNode principal. Add or uncomment the following properties in each file:

        ``` xml
        <property>
          <name>hadoop.security.authentication</name>
          <value>kerberos</value>
        </property>
        ```

    6.  If you are using YARN for resource management, edit the `yarn-client.xml` file to enable kerberos security. Add or uncomment the following property in the `yarn-client.xml` file on the **HAWQ master and each HAWQ segment node**:

        ``` xml
        <property>
          <name>hadoop.security.authentication</name>
          <value>kerberos</value>
        </property>
        ```

    7.  Restart your HAWQ cluster:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@master$ hawq restart cluster -a -M fast
        ```


### <a id="hawq_kerb_cfg"></a>Configure Kerberos User Authentication for HAWQ

You can configure HAWQ to require Kerberos authentication for user access to HAWQ databases. When HAWQ uses Kerberos for user authentication, it uses a standard principal to connect to the KDC. The format of this principal is `postgres/<FQDN_of_master>@<realm>`, where \<FQDN\_of\_master\> refers to the fully qualified distinguish name of the HAWQ master node.

The procedure to configure Kerberos user authentication for HAWQ includes:

- Creating a Kerberos principal and generating and distributing a keytab entry for the `postgres` process on the HAWQ master node
- Creating a Kerberos principal for the `gpadmin` or another administrative HAWQ user
- Updating the HAWQ `pg_hba.conf` configuration file to specify Kerberos authentication
- Restarting the HAWQ cluster

**Note**: When you enable Kerberos user authentication for HAWQ, you must create a Kerberos principal for `gpadmin` or another HAWQ administrative user.

#### Procedure <a id="hawq_kerb_cfg_proc"></a>

?? THIS PROCEDURE WILL CHANGE WHEN DETERMINE HOW THE TWO POSTGRES PRINCIPALS RELATE - i.e. may need need to add the postgres/master@REALM principal to existing keytab file with postgres@REALM (when HDFS kerberos enabled) rather than create a new file and update hawq config ??

Perform the following steps to configure Kerberos user authentication for HAWQ. You will perform operations on both the HAWQ \<master\> and the \<kdc-server\> nodes.

1. Log in to the KDC server system:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh root@<kdc-server>
    root@kdc-server$ 
    ```

2. Create a keytab entry for the HAWQ `postgres/<master>` principal using the `kadmin.local` command. Substitute the HAWQ master node fully qualified distinguished hostname and your Kerberos realm. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -randkey postgres/<master>@REALM.DOMAIN"
    ```
    
    The `addprinc` command adds the principal `postgres/<master>` to the KDC managing your \<realm\>.

3. Generate a keytab file for the HAWQ `postgres/<master>` principal. Provide the same name you used to create the principal:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "xst -norandkey -k hawq-krb5.keytab postgres/<master>@REALM.DOMAIN"
    ```

    The keytab entry is is saved to the `./hawq-krb5.keytab` file.

4. Use the `klist` command to view the key you just added to `hawq-krb5.keytab`:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ klist -ket ./hawq-krb5.keytab
    ```
    
    The `-ket` option lists the keytabs and encryption types in the identified key file.

5. Copy the keytab file to the HAWQ master node:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ scp ./hawq-krb5.keytab gpadmin@<master>:/home/gpadmin/
    ```

2. Create a Kerberos principal for the HAWQ `gpadmin` administrative role. Substitute your Kerberos realm. For example:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -pw changeme gpadmin@REALM.DOMAIN"
    ```
    
    This `addprinc` command adds the principal `gpadmin` to the KDC managing your \<realm\>. When you invoke `kadmin.local` as specified in the example above, `gpadmin` will be required to provide the password identified by the `-pw` option when authenticating. Alternatively, you can create a keytab file for the `gpadmin` principal and distribute the file to HAWQ client nodes.

6. Log in to the HAWQ master node as the `gpadmin` user and set up the HAWQ environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<master>
    gpadmin@master$ . /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
    ```
    
7. ???Verify the ownership and mode of the keytab file you copied to the master in a previous step:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ chown gpadmin:gpadmin /home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab
    gpadmin@master$ chmod 400 /home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab
    ```

    The HAWQ server keytab file must be readable (and preferably only readable) by the HAWQ `gpadmin` administrative account.

8. Add a `pg_hba.conf` entry that mandates Kerberos authentication for HAWQ. The `pg_hba.conf` file resides in the directory specified by the `hawq_master_directory` server configuration parameter value. For example, add:

    ``` pre
    host all all 0.0.0.0/0 gss include_realm=0 krb_realm=REALM.DOMAIN
    ```
    
    This `pg_hba.conf` entry specifies that any remote access (i.e. from any user on any remote host) to HAWQ must be authenticated through the Kerberos realm named `REALM.DOMAIN`.
    
    Place the Kerberos entry in the appropriate location in the `pg_hba.conf` file. Refer to [Configuring Client Authentication](client_auth.html) for additional information about the `pg_hba.conf` file.

9. Update HAWQ configuration. You will perform different procedures if you manage your cluster from the command line or use Ambari to manage your cluster.

    1. If you manage your cluster using Ambari:
    
        1.  Login in to the Ambari UI from a supported web browser.

        2. Navigate to the **HAWQ** service, **Configs > Advanced** tab and expand the **Custom hawq-site** drop down.

        3. Set the `krb_server_keyfile` path value to the new keytab file location, `/home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab`.

        4. **Save** this configuration change and then select the now orange **Restart > Restart All Affected** menu button to restart your HAWQ cluster.

        5. Exit the Ambari UI.  
    
    2. If you manage your cluster from the command line:
    
        1.  Update the `krb_server_keyfile` configuration parameter:

            ``` shell
            gpadmin@master$ hawq config -c krb_server_keyfile -v '/home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab'
            GUC krb_server_keyfile already exist in hawq-site.xml
            Update it with value: /home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab
            GUC      : krb_server_keyfile
            Value    : /home/gpadmin/hawq-krb5.keytab
            ```

        2.  Restart your HAWQ cluster:

            ``` shell
            gpadmin@master$ hawq restart cluster
            ```

10. When Kerberos user authentication is enabled for HAWQ, all users, including the `gpadmin` administrative user, must request a ticket to authenticate before performing HAWQ operations. Generate a ticket for `gpadmin` on the HAWQ master node:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ kinit gpadmin@<realm>
    Password for gpadmin@REALM.DOMAIN:
    ```
    
    See [Authenticate User Access to HAWQ](#hawq_kerb_dbaccess) for more information about requesting and generating Kerberos tickets. 

### <a id="hawq_kerb_user_cfg"></a>Configure Kerberos-Authenticated HAWQ Users

After enabling Kerberos user authentication for HAWQ, you will configure HAWQ user principals. The first component of a HAWQ user principal must be the HAWQ user/role name. For example:

``` pre
<hawq-user>@<realm>.
```

This procedure includes:

- Identifying an existing or creating a new HAWQ role for each user you want to authenticate with Kerberos
- Creating a Kerberos principal for each role
- Optionally generating and distributing a keytab file to all HAWQ clients from which you will access HAWQ as the new role

#### Procedure <a id="hawq_kerb_user_cfg_proc"></a>

Perform the following steps to configure Kerberos authentication for specific HAWQ users. You will perform operations on both the HAWQ \<master\> and the \<kdc-server\> nodes.

1. Log in to the HAWQ master node as the `gpadmin` user and set up your HAWQ environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@master
    gpadmin@master$ . /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. Create a Kerberos-authorized HAWQ user/role. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@master$ psql -d template1 -c 'CREATE ROLE "bill/kerberos" with LOGIN;'
    ```

    This step creates a HAWQ operational role. Create an administrative HAWQ role by adding the `SUPERUSER` clause to the `CREATE ROLE` command.
    
    Alternatively, you may identify the name of an existing HAWQ user/role.

2. Create a principal for the HAWQ role. Substitute the Kerberos realm you noted earlier. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh root@<kdc-server>
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc -pw changeme bill/kerberos@<REALM.DOMAIN"
    ```

3. You may choose to have the HAWQ role authenticate with a password or a keytab file. 

    1. If you choose password authentication, no further configuration is required. Skip the rest of this step.
    
    2. If you choose authentication via a keytab file:
    
        1. Generate a keytab file for the HAWQ principal, again substituting your Kerberos realm. For example:

            ``` shell
            root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "xst -k bill-krb5.keytab bill/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN”
            ```

            The keytab entry is saved to the `./bill-krb5.keytab` file.

        2. View the key you just added to `bill-krb5.keytab`:

            ``` shell
            root@kdc-server$ klist -ket ./bill-krb5.keytab
            ```

        3. Distribute the keytab file to **all** HAWQ nodes from which you will access the HAWQ master as the user/role. For example:

            ``` shell
            root@kdc-server$ scp ./bill-krb5.keytab bill@<hawq-node>:/home/bill/
            ```

4. Log in to the HAWQ node as the user for whom you created the principal and set up your HAWQ environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh bill@<hawq-node>
    bill@hawq-node$ . /usr/local/hawq/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

5. If you are using keytab file authentication, verify the ownership and mode of the keytab file:

    ``` shell
    bill@hawq-node$ chown bill:bill /home/bill/bill-krb5.keytab
    bill@hawq-node$ chmod 400 /home/bill/bill-krb5.keytab
    ```

8. Try to connect to a HAWQ database as the new `bill/kerberos` user:

    ``` shell
    bill@hawq-node$ psql -d testdb -h <master> -U bill/kerberos
    psql: GSSAPI continuation error: Unspecified GSS failure.  Minor code may provide more information
    GSSAPI continuation error: Credentials cache file '/tmp/krb5cc_502' not found
    ```

    The operation fails. The `bill/kerberos` user has not yet authenticated with the Kerberos server.

### <a id="hawq_kerb_dbaccess"></a>Authenticate User Access to HAWQ 

When Kerberos user authentication is enabled for HAWQ, you must request a ticket from the KDC server before connecting to HAWQ. You must request the ticket for a principal matching the requested database user name. When granted, the ticket expires after a set period of time, after which you will need to request another ticket.
   
To generate a Kerberos ticket, run the `kinit` command. Specify the Kerberos principal for which you are requesting the ticket in a command option. You may optionally specify a path to a keytab file.

For example, to request a ticket for the `bill/kerberos` user principal you created above using the keytab file for authentication:

``` shell
bill@hawq-node$ kinit -k -t /home/bill/bill-krb5.keytab bill/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN
```

To request a ticket for the `bill/kerberos` user principal using password authentication:

``` shell
bill@hawq-node$ kinit -k bill/kerberos@<realm>
Password for bill/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN:
```

`kinit` prompts you for the password; enter the password at the prompt.

For more information about the ticket, use the `klist` command. `klist` invoked without any arguments lists the currently held Kerberos principal and tickets. The command output also provides the ticket expiration time. 

Example output from the `klist` command:

``` shell
bill@hawq-node$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_502
Default principal: bill/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
06/07/17 23:16:04  06/08/17 23:16:04  krbtgt/REALM.DOMAIN@REALM.DOMAIN
	renew until 06/07/17 23:16:04
06/07/17 23:16:07  06/08/17 23:16:04  postgres/master@
	renew until 06/07/17 23:16:04
06/07/17 23:16:07  06/08/17 23:16:04  postgres/master@REALM.DOMAIN
	renew until 06/07/17 23:16:04
```

After generating a ticket, you can connect to a HAWQ database as a kerberos-authenticated user using `psql` or other client programs.

#### <a id="topic7"></a>Name Mapping 

To simplify Kerberos-authenticated HAWQ user login, you can define a mapping between a user's Kerberos principal name and a HAWQ database user name. You define the mapping in the `pg_ident.conf` file. You use a mapping by specifying a `map=<map-name>` option to a specific entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file. 

The `pg_ident.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` files reside on the HAWQ master node in the directory identified by the `hawq_master_directory` server configuration parameter setting value.

The `pg_ident.conf` file defines the user name map. You can create entries in this file that define a mapping name, a Kerberos principal name, and a HAWQ database user name. For example:

```
# MAPNAME   SYSTEM-USERNAME        HAWQ-USERNAME
kerbmap     /^(.*)/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN$   \1
```

This entry extracts the first component of the Kerberos principal name and maps that to a HAWQ user/role of the same name. With the appropriate identity service set up and this mapping in place, if your operating system user name is `bill` and you log in to HAWQ, the login is mapped to the Kerberos principal name `bill/kerberos@REALM.DOMAIN` automatically for you; you do not need to specify the `-U bill/kerberos` option to the `psql` command. ?? IS THIS HOW IT WORKS ??

Identify the map name in the `pg_hba.conf` file in the entry that enables Kerberos support. For example:

```
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 gss include_realm=0 krb_realm=REALM.DOMAIN map=kerbmap
```

For more information about specifying username maps see [Username maps](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/auth-username-maps.html) in the Postgres documentation.

## <a id="client_considerations"></a>Kerberos Considerations for Non-HAWQ Clients

If you access HAWQ databases from any clients outside of your HAWQ cluster, you must specifically configure Kerberos access on each client system. Ensure that:

- The `krb5-libs` and `krb5-workstation` Kerberos client packages are installed on each client.
- You copy the `/etc/krb5.conf` Kerberos configuration file in use by the HAWQ cluster  to each client system.
- You have created the appropriate Kerberos principal for the HAWQ user and optionally generated and distributed the keytab file.
- The HAWQ user has requested a ticket before connecting to HAWQ.

## <a id="topic9"></a>Configure Kerberos-Authenticated JDBC Access to HAWQ

?? DETERMINE IF/HOW THIS RELATES TO JDBC CONFIG FOR RANGER KERBEROS AND MODIFY/RELOCATE APPROPRIATELY ??

JDBC applications that you run must utilize a secure connection when Kerberos is configured for HAWQ user authentication.

The following example database connection URL uses a PostgreSQL JDBC driver and specifies parameters for Kerberos authentication:

```
jdbc:postgresql://master:5432/testdb?kerberosServerName=postgres&jaasApplicationName=pgjdbc&user=bill/kerberos
```

The connection URL parameter names and values that you specify will depend upon how the Java application performs Kerberos authentication.

### <a id="topic9_prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before configuring JDBC access to a kerberized HAWQ ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

-  For non-OpenJDK Java installations, verify that the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) is installed on the client system.
- Kerberos user authentication is configured for HAWQ as described in [Configure Kerberos User Authentication for HAWQ](#hawq_kerb_cfg).
-  If you are accessing HAWQ from a non-HAWQ client node, verify that the client is configured appropriately as described in [Kerberos Considerations for Non-HAWQ Clients](#client_considerations).

### <a id="topic9_proc"></a>Procedure

Perform the following procedure to enable Kerberos-authenticated JDBC access to HAWQ from a client system.

1.  Create or add the following to the `.java.login.config` file in the `$HOME` directory of the user account under which the application will run:

    ``` pre
    pgjdbc {
      com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
      doNotPrompt=true
      useTicketCache=true
      debug=true
      client=true;
    };
    ```

2.  Modify the `java.security` file?

3.  Generate a Kerberos ticket.

4.  Run the JDBC-based HAWQ application.


## <a id="task_setup_kdc"></a>Appendix: Install and Configure a Kerberos KDC Server 

**Note:** If your installation already has a KDC server, you do not need to perform this procedure. Take note of the KDC server host name or IP address and the name of the realm in which your cluster resides. You will need this information later.

Follow these steps to install and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center \(KDC\) server on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. The KDC server resides on the host named \<kdc-server\>.

1. Log in to the KDC Server system as a superuser:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh root@<kdc-server>
    root@kdc-server$ 
    ```

2.  Install the Kerberos server packages:

    ``` shell
    root@kdc-server$ yum install krb5-libs krb5-server krb5-workstation
    ```

3.  Define the Kerberos realm for your cluster by editting the `/etc/krb5.conf` configuration file. The following example configures a Kerberos server with a realm named `REALM.DOMAIN` residing on a host named `hawq-kdc`.

    ```
    [logging]
     default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
     kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
     admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

    [libdefaults]
     default_realm = REALM.DOMAIN
     dns_lookup_realm = false
     dns_lookup_kdc = false
     ticket_lifetime = 24h
     renew_lifetime = 7d
     forwardable = true
     default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-hmac-sha1 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
     default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-hmac-sha1 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
     permitted_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-hmac-sha1 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5

    [realms]
     REALM.DOMAIN = {
      kdc = hawq-kdc:88
      admin_server = hawq-kdc:749
      default_domain = hawq-kdc
     }

    [domain_realm]
     .hawq-kdc = REALM.DOMAIN
     hawq-kdc = REALM.DOMAIN

    [appdefaults]
     pam = {
        debug = false
        ticket_lifetime = 36000
        renew_lifetime = 36000
        forwardable = true
        krb4_convert = false
       }
    ```

    The `kdc` and `admin_server` keys in the `[realms]` section specify the host \(`hawq-kdc`\) and port on which the Kerberos server is running. You can use an IP address in place of a host name.

    If your Kerberos server manages authentication for other realms, you would instead add the `REALM.DOMAINM` realm in the `[realms]` and `[domain_realm]` sections of the `krb5.conf` file. See the [Kerberos documentation](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/) for detailed information about the `krb5.conf` configuration file.

4. Note the KDC server host name or IP address and the name of the realm in which your cluster resides. You will need this information in later steps.
5.  Create a Kerberos KDC database by running the `kdb5_util` command:

    ```
    root@kdc-server$ kdb5_util create -s
    ```

    The `kdb5_util create` command creates the database in which the keys for the Kerberos realms managed by this KDC server are stored. The `-s` option instructs the command to create a stash file. Without the stash file, the KDC server will request a password every time it starts.

6.  Add an administrative user to the KDC database with the `kadmin.local` utility. Because it does not itself depend on Kerberos authentication, the `kadmin.local` utility allows you to add an initial administrative user to the local Kerberos server. To add the user `admin` as an administrative user to the KDC database, run the following command:

    ```
    root@kdc-server$ kadmin.local -q "addprinc admin/admin"
    ```

    Most users do not need administrative access to the Kerberos server. They can use `kadmin` to manage their own principals \(for example, to change their own password\). For information about `kadmin`, see the [Kerberos documentation](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/).

7.  If required, edit the `/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl` file to grant the appropriate permissions to `admin`.
8.  Start the Kerberos daemons:

    ```
    root@kdc-server$ /sbin/service krb5kdc start
    root@kdc-server$ /sbin/service kadmin start
    ```

9.  To start Kerberos automatically upon restart:

    ```
    root@kdc-server$ /sbin/chkconfig krb5kdc on
    root@kdc-server$ /sbin/chkconfig kadmin on
    ```
