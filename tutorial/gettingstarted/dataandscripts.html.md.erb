title: Sample Data Set and Scripts
---

The _Getting Started with HAWQ_ exercises operate on an example data set.  This data set is provided in a set of `gzip`'d `.tsv` (tab-separated values) text files. The exercises also reference scripts and other supporting files included with the data set.

In this section, you are introduced to the example data set.  You will also download and examine the data set and work files if they are not already present on your system.

## <a id="tut_exdownloadfilessteps"></a>Download the Data and Script Files

If not already present in your HAWQ installation or sandbox, perform the following steps to download the sample files.  These files include the sample data set and scripts.

1. Open a terminal window and `ssh` into the sandbox as the `gpadmin` user.

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<sandbox>
    ```

2. Determine if the tutorial work files are present on your system:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@sandbox$ ??WHERE WOULD THEY BE??
    ```
    
    If the work files are present, skip to step 5 of this exercise.
    
3. Create a working directory for the data files and scripts:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@sandbox$ mkdir $HOME/hawqgetstart
    gpadmin@sandbox$ cd $HOME/hawqgetstart
    ```
    
    Ensure that all path components up to and including the `hawqgetstart` base directory have read and execute permissions for all.

4. Download the data set from `github` and check out the appropriate tag/branch:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@sandbox$ git clone git@github.com:lisakowen/pivotal-samples.git  ?? REPLACE WITH REAL REPO NAME ??
    gpadmin@sandbox$ cd pivotal-samples
    gpadmin@sandbox$ git checkout hdb<version>_tutorial
    ```
    where \<version\> identifies the current version of HDB (dots included, i.e. `hdb2.1.1_tutorial`).
   
5. Save the path to the work files base directory:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@sandbox$ export HAWQGSBASE=$HOME/hawqgetstart/pivotal-samples
    ```
    
    You may want to add this environment variable setting to your `.bash_profile`.

Exercises reference work files in  the `pivotal-samples` directory, which includes various subdirectories:

The HAWQ and PXF exercises include various SQL, shell, and perl scripts to create, load, and verify table creation.

## <a id="tut_datasetschema"></a>Data Set Schema

The sample Retail data set used in the tutorial exercises models an online retail store operation.  The store carries different categories of products.  Customers order the products.  The company delivers the products.

The Retail data set includes the following entities.  Orders and order line items are fact tables.  The other entities are represented in dimension tables.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Entity</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>customers_dim</td>
    <td>Customer data: first/last name, id, gender</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>email_addresses_dim</td>
    <td>Customer e-mail addresses</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>product_dim</td>
    <td>Product details including name, id, category, and price</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>customer_addresses_dim</td>
    <td>Address and phone number of each customer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>order_lineitems</td>
    <td>Line item for each order: includes id, item id, category, store, shipping address, and other fields; references a specific product ordered by a specific customer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>orders</td>
    <td>Details of an order: includes id, payment method, billing address, day/time, and other fields; orders are associated with a specific customer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>categories_dim</td>
    <td>Product categories</td>
  </tr>
